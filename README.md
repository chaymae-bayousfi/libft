🚀 Libft – My First Step into C Programming!
🎯 About The Project

Libft is my first project at 1337 School, where I recreated various standard C library functions from scratch. This journey was not just about coding – it was about understanding the fundamental building blocks of the C programming language. 🏗️

🌟 What I Learned
✅ Memory Management in C 🧠
✅ String Manipulation & Data Structures 🔠📚
✅ Writing clean & well-documented code 📝
✅ The importance of optimization & efficiency ⚡
✅ Unit Testing & Debugging 🛠️

💡 Personal Experience
Starting Libft was exciting and challenging! As a new student at 1337, this project pushed me to:

🔥 Collaborate with peers during code reviews 👥
🧩 Think critically about implementation choices 🤔
🐛 Debug tirelessly to solve tricky errors 🚨
🛠️ Develop a strong foundation in C programming 💻

🤝 Peer Learning Experience
One of the most valuable aspects of working on Libft was the peer learning environment at 1337. Through:

💬 Late-night debugging sessions with fellow students 🌙
🔄 Sharing different approaches to the same problems 🤯
🛠️ Learning from mistakes (both mine & others') 📖
🤝 Building lasting friendships in the coding community ❤️
